=head1 NAME

Log::Report::Extract::PerlPPI - Collect translatable strings from Perl using PPI

=head1 INHERITANCE

 Log::Report::Extract::PerlPPI
   is a Log::Report::Extract

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $ppi = Log::Report::Extract::PerlPPI->new
  ( lexicon => '/usr/share/locale'
  );
 $ppi->process('lib/My/Pkg.pm');  # call for each .pm file
 $ppi->showStats;                 # optional
 $ppi->write;

 # See script  xgettext-perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module helps maintaining the POT files, updating the list of
message-ids which are kept in them.  After initiation, the L<process()|Log::Report::Extract::PerlPPI/"Processors">
method needs to be called with all files which changed since last processing
and the existing PO files will get updated accordingly.

If no translations exist yet, one C<$lexicon/$domain.po> file will be
created.  If you want to start a translation, copy C<$lexicon/$domain.po>
to C<$lexicon/$domain/$lang.po> and edit that file.  You may use
C<poedit> to edit po-files.  Do not forget to add the new po-file to
your distribution (MANIFEST)

=head2 The extraction process

All pm-files need to be processed in one go: no incremental processing!

The Perl source is parsed using PPI, which does understand Perl syntax
quite well, but does not support all features.

Automatically, the textdomain of the translations is discovered, as
first parameter of C<use Log::Report>.  You may switch textdomain inside
one pm-file.

When all files have been processed, during the L<write()|Log::Report::Extract/"Processors">, all existing
po-files for all discovered textdomains will get updated.  Not only the
C<$lexicon/$domain.po> template, but also all C<$lexicon/$domain/$lang.po>
will be replaced.  When a msgid has disappeared, existing translations
will get disabled, not removed.  New msgids will be added and flagged
"fuzzy".

=head3 What is extracted?

This script will extract the msgids used in C<__()>, C<__x()>, C<__xn()>,
and C<__n()> (implemented by L<Log::Report|Log::Report>) For instance

  __x"msgid", @more
  __x'msgid', @more  <--- no!  syntax error!
  __x("msgid", @more)
  __x('msgid', @more)
  __x(msgid => @more)

Besides, there are some helpers which are no-ops in the code, only to fill
the po-tables: C<N__()>, C<N__n()>, C<N__()>

=head3 What is not extracted?

B<Not> extracted are the usage of anything above, where the first
parameter is not a simple string.  Not extracted are

  __x($format, @more)
  __x$format, @more
  __x(+$format, _domain => 'other domain', @more)
  __x($first.$second, @more)

In these cases, you have to use C<N__()> functions to declare the possible
values of C<$format>.
